# A file comparison program

## Overview

This crate is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) port of the classic file comparison program originally implemented in C.

For a detailed description of the underlying algorithm, see:

- Miller, W., and Myers, E. W. “A File Comparison Program.” Software: Practice & Experience 15, no. 11 (1985): 1025–1040.
- Myers, E. W. “An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations.” Technical Report 85-6, Department of Computer Science, University of Arizona, 1985.

This crate is also my tribute to Eugene Myers for his influential work on diff algorithms, hence the name `myers`.
